# Defining Variables
my_array = [1, 4, 7, 9]  # Array variable with the elements 1, 4, 7, 9

# Order of Operations
# Define variables
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4

# Fully-Bracketed Version of: e = a - b ** c // d + a % c
e = (a - ((b ** c) // d) + (a % c))  # Fully bracketed version

# Formatting
temperature = 32.6
print(f"The temperature today is: {temperature:.3f} degrees Celsius")  # Use formatting for precision

# Common Functions
userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))  # Get user input and convert to integer
userAge += 22  # Add 22 to the user's age
print(f"Now showing the shop items filtered by age: {userAge}")  # Print the result
